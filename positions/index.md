## Open Positions

### Software Engineer

We have released a brand-new version of S²E. It has a rearchitected engine
that is fast and modular, advanced support for Windows and Linux guests, etc. An
alpha version of it was the fastest at finding vulnerabilities in the [DARPA
Cyber Grand Challenge](http://archive.darpa.mil/cybergrandchallenge/).

We are now gearing up for releasing the next set of advanced features. Among them
redesigned plugin architecture with Python support, better vulnerability
finding capabilities, support for more guest OSes, and an even faster engine
running code at hardware speeds.

We're looking for people to join us ASAP in this effort. If you’re a hardcore
systems programmer, are passionate about security, and want to revolutionize the
level of reliability and security in systems software, let’s talk!

You’ll be joining the research [team](/people) at [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch) and
will collaborate with [Cyberhaven](http://cyberhaven.io), an advanced software
security startup located at the [EPFL Innovation
Park](http://epfl-innovationpark.ch/), on the shore of Lake Geneva. The project
is sponsored by the [Swiss Commission for Technology and
Innovation](https://www.kti.admin.ch/kti/en/home.html).

We’re looking for people who are exceptionally strong in computer systems, love
hacking both inside and outside an OS kernel, and have a proven track record of
building systems, contributing to open source projects, etc. If C/C++ is your
mother tongue and you’re comfortable coding at any layer in the software stack,
[email](mailto:cristian.zamfir@epfl.ch) us the following materials:

1. Resume or Curriculum Vitae (please include descriptions of previous projects
you have worked on);

2. Contact information (email + phone) for two references who have agreed to
speak about you, your work, and your potential. Please do not send us open
letters of recommendation; we will directly contact your reference providers and
solicit confidential feedback on you.

We evaluate candidates on an ongoing basis, so please submit the materials as
soon as they are available.
