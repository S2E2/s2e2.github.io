## Latest Releases

You can find the latest stable version of S2E on master. We compile here from time to time a list of features
available as of a given date.


### 14 Jan. 2019

 * QEMU 3.0 support
 * Windows 7 32-bit guest support
 * Ubuntu 18.04 host support
 * Documentation updates
    * KVM interface design
    * Testing error recovery code in Windows drivers with multi-path fault injection
    * Using SystemTap with S2E
    * Combining Kaitai Struct and S2E for analyzing parsers
    * Analyzing trigger-based malware with S2E
    * Automated proof of vulnerability generation on Linux, Windows, and Decree platforms
    * Getting code coverage for various types of binaries
    * Setting up Windows development environment
 * Various engine fixes and refactorings


### 16 Oct. 2017 - S²E V2.0

 * Rearchitected version of S²E, decoupled from QEMU
 * KVM-compatible interface
   * ``libs2e.so`` is a shim library that intercepts ``ioctl`` to ``/dev/kvm``
   * can be ``LD_PRELOAD``ed into QEMU or any other KVM-compatible VMM.
 * Modular and flexible architecture, any component of S²E can be reused independently
   * ``libs2e``: exposes the symbolic execution engine and the dynamic binary translator through a KVM-compatible interface
   * ``libs2ecore``: main S²E execution engine
   * ``libs2eplugins``: S²E plugins
   * ``libcpu``: processor emulation library, extracted from QEMU 1.0
   * ``libtcg``: dynamic binary translator backend, extracted from QEMU 1.0
   * ``libvmi``: virtual machine introspection library
   * ``libq``: JSON serialization support, to interface S²E with Web services, extracted from QEMU 1.0
   * ``libcoroutine``: cooperative threading support, extracted from QEMU 1.0
   * ``libfsigc++``: fast drop-in replacement for the ``libsigc++`` library
   * ``klee``: symbolic LLVM interpreter
   * ``lua``: LUA scripting engine
 * Supports latest versions of Linux and Windows XP, 7, 8, 8.1, 10
   * Windows crash dump generation, compatible with WinDbg
   * Exposes OS events to plugins (process/thread creation/destruction, memory mappings, module loads, etc.)
 * Advanced tooling to easily set up symbolic execution for arbitrary programs
   * Automatic generation of S²E configuration file and launch script based on the binary to analyze
   * Easy file transfers between the guest and the host during symbolic execution, ideal for per-path core dump extraction, etc.
   * Code coverage support
 * Up to 6x faster concrete execution than S²E 1.3
 * Z3 constraint solver
 * Extensive set of plugins and tools for vulnerability analysis and proof of vulnerability generation
   * Easily show the exploitability of a crash
   * Demonstrated during the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge
 * Concolic execution
 * State merging
   * Exponentially reduces number of paths to explore by combining similar execution paths
 * Function models
   * Exponentially reduces number of paths to explore by replacing standard library functions with equivalent models
 * Advanced path searchers
   * Modular searcher architecture, mix and match existing searchers, and combine them with your own
   * Class-Uniform Path Analysis minimizes likelihood of exploration getting stuck
 * Fuzzer integration
   * ``SeedSearcher`` plugin automatically picks up seeds generated by a fuzzer or other analysis tools and schedules them for exploration
   * Generate new test cases that can be used to guide fuzzers and other tools
 * Revgen: static x86 to LLVM translator
