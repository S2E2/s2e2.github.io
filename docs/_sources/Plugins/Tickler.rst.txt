Automated malware analysis
==========================

In this section, we will explain how to configure S2E in order to automatically analyze large numbers of documents.

The main challenge resides in deciding when to terminate the analysis. In case of a malicious document, it is pretty
simple: when the first CFI violation is detected. For benign documents, however, it is more involved.

In this section, we will discuss how to configure the CFI checker so that it can be run unattended. This is useful if
you want, e.g., integrate S2E into a malware scanning service.

TODO: discuss the tickler.

  The tickler is a tool that interacts with the Word UI, e.g., by dismissing various messages boxes and
  scrolling the document. We will discuss it in more details later.
